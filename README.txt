# Hot Potato â€” Deployable Web App

This is a fully static web app you can deploy on Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

## Quick Start
1. Deploy the folder as-is to Netlify (drag-and-drop or connect repo).  
2. Ensure your GIFs live under `assets/gifs/`. You can create `assets/gifs/index.json` listing the filenames if you want explicit control.
3. Place or replace audio in `assets/music-file.mp3` and `assets/scream.mp3` (already included from your uploads).
4. Edit translations and prompts in `locales/*.json`.

The app is a PWA and works offline after first load. No analytics or personal data collection.
